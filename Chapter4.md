### There exist five basic types of neuron connection architecture:
- Single layer feed forward network 
- Multi layer feed forward network
- Single node with its own feedback
- Single layer recurrent network
- Multi layer recurrent network

When outputs can be directed back as inputs to the same layer or preceding layer nodes, then it results in feedback networks. Recurrent networks are feedback networks with closed loops.
